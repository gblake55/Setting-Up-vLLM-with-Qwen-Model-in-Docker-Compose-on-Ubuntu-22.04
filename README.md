Setting Up vLLM with Qwen Model in Docker Compose on Ubuntu 22.04

I have created a concise README that covers the essential steps to get up and running quickly. It includes:

Quick install commands - Copy-paste ready
Complete docker-compose.yml - Ready to use
Model selection guide - Choose based on GPU memory
Common commands - For daily operations
Quick troubleshooting - Solve common issues fast

The README is designed to get someone from zero to chatting with Qwen in just a few minutes!
